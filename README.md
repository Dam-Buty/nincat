## ‚ö° Installing

### Arch Linux (Manjaro, Artix, Arco...)

With an AUR helper, you can install it with the package called `nincat-git`.
Example with [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru):

```zsh
paru -S nincat-git
nincat --random --center
```

### By Github

Click in `Code` in this repository and then `Download ZIP`. Extract it using your favourite tool and then in your terminal: 
```zsh
cd PUT_HERE_THE_PATH_OF_NINCAT
make
nincat --random --right
```

### By Git

From your terminal, you can clone in your preferred folder:
```zsh
git clone 'https://github.com/ninecath/nincat'
cd nincat
make
nincat --random
```

### Loading it

Probably you want to put when your Terminal opens, that is, when your shell is loaded. If you don't care a lot about shells, you probably use `bash`, maybe `zsh` with `Oh my zsh`.
Anyway, all you need to do is add this line in your shell **rc** changing the location for `nincat` script, then you'll be able to load it when the terminal opens :)
To verify what shell you use, run `echo $SHELL` in your terminal.

+ For `zsh` the	rc is put in `~/.zshrc`;
+ For `bash` the rc is put in `~/.bashrc`;
+ For `fish` the config is put in `~/.config/fish/config.fish`;
+ etc... search for the documentation of your shell if it isn't listed here.

```zsh
nincat random
```

**TIP**: Faster is better, if you have the `dash` shell installed in your machine, consider using it (it's 4x faster than bash and considered the fastest shell) with the following line:
```zsh
which nincat
dash LOCATION_OF_NINCAT random
```

In **Arch Linux (...based ditros)** you can use `pacman -S dash` to install it.

I'd recommend, too, you putting the line in the top of your shell.

+ **lolcat** (optional)
  - [Please, use its faster implantation](https://github.com/jaseg/lolcat) for performance.
  - You can disable this dependency by just removing the `/ascii_arts/   _   lolcat` folder in the root directory of `nincat`.
+ **gay** (optional)
  - [source](https://github.com/ms-jpq/gay)
  - You can disable this dependency by just removing the `/ascii_arts/   _   gay` folder in the root directory of `nincat`.

## ‚úèÔ∏è  Contributing/Adding ASCII arts:

File names are made in this format: `<name-of-art> <max-rows-size-of-art> <max-columns-size-of-art>`. **Yes, it does contain those last two spaces, do not forget it, it's important!** They are put in the `/ascii_arts/`. You can make a separate folder to add your own arts.

\* If the art was made by another artist, please -- please -- add her/his name to the first line tagging him/her as the original artist, the maintainer (s) cannot verify each art being added and definitely that would show a little bit of kindness that can make a difference in this big universe. Thank you.

Things to do while creating a new art:
+ Use spaces (DO NOT USE TABS!);

Please, do not fill all the lines with spaces to close all columns. A good and simple example should be:
```
# Your wonderful username/name and/or extra information
   (   )
: ) o_o ( :
```

**Note:**

Since it is kinda hard adding colours and effects to it, I actually developed [a tool](ninecath.github.io/) to write easily ASCII arts. Here's its [source code](https://github.com/ninecath/ninecath.github.io/). It still in development, but it is far better than writing on a text editor.

##### Colours

[Give a look at this site for **256, 88, 16 colours** in your ASCII arts](https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting).
And obviously, you should utilize `\033` instead of `\e`.

For **true colours**, [I'd recommend this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4842424/list-of-ansi-color-escape-sequences).

### üíû Please, contribute!

It would be lovely that for every art you add, you add it here, too! Remember to put your name in the first line, so your contribution is never forgotten :)

#### By Github's Pull Request (recommended)

Clone this project, add your art in a file in either manually with **Github** or with **git**, then send a pull request here comparing both branches.

#### By Github's Issue

Create a new issue in the `New art` option and put there your art.

#### Literally email (not recommended, please)

Send an email to `koetemagie@gmail.com` with your art, do not forget to put your name in the first line and email. If you forgot, I will add it for you :)
