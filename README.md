<p align="center"><b>Let's revive the ASCII art!</b></p>

<p align="center">This a simple script that loads an ASCII art centered in your terminal.</p>

---

## üåü Features:
+ Fast and lightweight;
+ A single run for almost every command, except `printf` and `grep` **–©(‚ó£–¥‚ó¢)–©**;
+ Self adapt with the terminal size to print only ASCII arts that fit;
+ Supports **lolcat** arts (if there's more programs like **lolcat**, we can support it, too :)
+ Skip empty ASCII art files;
+ We'll always give you more, baby!

## ‚ö° Installing

#### By Github

Click in `Code` in this repository and then `Download ZIP`. Extract it using your favourite tool and then in your terminal: 
```zsh
cd PUT_HERE_THE_PATH_OF_NINCAT
./nincat
```

#### By Git

From your terminal, you can clone in your preferred folder:
```zsh
git clone 'https://github.com/BeyondMagic/nincat.git'
cd nincat
./nincat
```

### Loading it

Probably you want to put when your Terminal opens, that is, when your shell is loaded. If you don't care a lot about shells, you probably use `bash`, maybe `zsh` with `Oh my zsh`.
Anyway, all you need to do is add this line in your shell **rc** changing the location for `nincat` folder, then you'll be able to load it when the terminal opens :)
To verify what shell you use, run `echo $SHELL` in your terminal.

+ For `zsh` the rc is put in `~/.zshrc`;
+ For `bash` the rc is put in `~/.bashrc`;
+ For `fish` the config is put in `~/.config/fish/config.fish`;
+ etc... search for the documentation of your shell if it isn't listed here.

```zsh
LOCATION_OF_NINCAT/nincat
```

**TIP**: Faster is better, if have the `dash` shell installed in your machine, consider using it (it's 4x faster than bash and considered the fastest shell) with the following line:
```zsh
dash LOCATION_OF_NINCAT/nincat
```

In **Arch Linux (...based ditros)** you can use `pacman -S dash` to install it.

I'd recommend, too, you putting the line in the top of your shell.

<!-- ### Arch Linux (...based distros)

With an AUR helper, you can install it with the package called `nincat-git`.
E.j. with yay:

```zsh
yay -s nincat-git
```

## üò™ Dependencies:
+ **lolcat** (optional)
  - [Please, use its faster implentation](https://github.com/jaseg/lolcat)
  - So, if you want to, you can disable this dependency by just removing the `lolcat` folder in `ascii_arts` in the root. And if you know a little bit of shell scripting, remove its condition on the script file.

## ‚úèÔ∏è  Adding new ASCII arts:

Filenames are made in this format: `<name-of-art> <rows-size-of-art> <columns-size-of-art>`. **Yes, it does contain spaces, do not forget it, it's important!** They are put in the `/ascii_arts/`. You can make a separate folder to add your own arts.

Please, do not fill all the lines with spaces to close all columns. A good and simple example should be:
```
# Your wonderful username/name and/or extra information
   (   )
: ) o_o ( :
```

**Please, run the "update_ascii_arts" script if you want to make sure your file is correctly put!**

Because If you do not want to count the rows and columns of your file, just run the update script called `/update_ascii_arts` in the root path.
If you added colours on you art, remember that you do not have to put a' reset colour' after it. nincat will do that for you.

[Give a look at this site for colours in your ASCII arts](https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting).
And obviously, I ask you to utilize `\033` instead of `\e` as the site shows!.

### üíû Please, contribute!

It would be lovely that for every art you add, you add it here, too! Remember to put your name in the first line, so your contribution is never forgetten :)

#### By Github's Issue

Create a new issue in the `New art` option and put there your art.

#### By Github's Pull Request

Clone this project, add your art in a file in either manually with **Github** or with **git**, then send a pull request here comparing both branches.

#### Literally email

Send an email to `koetemagie@gmail.com` with your art, do not forget to put your name in the first line and email. If you forgot, I will add it for you :)

## ‚ùó Note:

This is heavily inspired by [**shell-colors-scripts**](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/shell-color-scripts/-/tree/master) (project made by DT. [His video about **shell-colors-scripts**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z1OKN6TgxI).

So I created this for a faster and easier way to contribute with ASCII arts.
