# DESCRIPTION:
#   This a simple script that loads an ASCII art in the origin path of this.
#
#   It will look for art that can be loaded in the terminal size.
#   So I do recommend you to have multiple arts.
#
#   If you want nincat to print faster, then just use a POSIX-compliant shell,
#   I do recommend dash (which as 4x faster than bash).
# 
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   + lolcat (optional)
#     - Please, use the faster implentation (https://github.com/jaseg/lolcat)
#     - If you want to, you can disable this dependency by
#       just removing the 'lolcat' folder in 'ascii_arts' in the root.
